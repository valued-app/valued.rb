# Valued Ruby SDK

This repository contains two separate gems:

* [valued-client](valued-client) – a general purpose Ruby client for Valued.
* [valued-rails](valued-rails) – a Rails plugin for Valued.

## Development

Task                         | Command
-----------------------------|---------------------
Installing dependencies      | `bundle install`
Running test                 | `rake test`
Generating API documentation | `rake docs`

You can also run both tasks combined with `rake`. These will generate a `docs` and a `coverage` directory.
