# Valued Ruby client

A Ruby client library for sending events to [Valued](https://valued.app).

This library:
* Is well tested (100% test coverage).
* Does not make assumptions about your application/library desgin.
* Does not patch any external classes or modules.
* Only depends on one other gem (concurrent-ruby).
* Is considered thread-safe and compatible with all common concurrency models (multi-threading, forking, actors, event loops, etc).

## Simple usage

You can create a `Valued::Client` instance and call `action`, `page_view`, `sync` etc directly on the client.

``` ruby
require "valued"

# Get the token for authentication.
token = ENV.fetch("VALUED_TOKEN") # or wherever you store credentials

# Create a client
client = Valued::Client.new(token)

# Record a page view event for the user with the id 123
client.page_view("https://big.company.com/learn/to/waltz", "user.id" => 123)

# Record an action
client.action("report.generated", {
  customer: { id: 12 },
  user: { id: 123 },
  attributes: { format: :pdf }
})

# Sync user data
client.sync_user({
  id: 123,
  name: "Josh Kalderimis",
  email: "josh@valued.app",
  location: { country: "NZ", region: "Wellington" }
})
```

## Incremental scope building

You can use `Valued::Scope` to build up data incrementally:

``` ruby
scope = Valued::Scope.new(client)
scope["user.id"] = 123

# user nagivates to customer with id 12
scope.with("customer.id" => 12) do
  scope.page_view("https://big.company.com/reports/12")
  scope.action("report.generated")
end

# trigger an action without a customer
scope.page_view("https://big.company.com/profile")
scope.action("profile.updated")
```

This is also handy for building up sync data:

``` ruby
scope.user = {
  id: 42, name: "Arthur Dent", email: "sandwich-maker@example.com"
}

scope.customer = {
  id: 1, name: "BBC Radio"
}

scope.sync
```

## Global scope

If you are in an environment that makes sharing global scope easier than explicitely passing around scope, like a Rails application, you can use one globally shared Client instance and a thread-local scope directly via the `Valued` module:

``` ruby
Valued.connect(token)

# Wrap this in a scope so we don't leak a user id.
Valued.scope do
  Valued["user.id"] = 123

  # user nagivates to customer with id 12
  Valued.with("customer.id" => 12) do
    Valued.page_view("https://big.company.com/reports/12")
    Valued.action("report.generated")
  end

  # trigger an action without a customer
  Valued.page_view("https://big.company.com/profile")
  Valued.action("profile.updated")
end
```

You can also connect an existing client instance to the global scope:

``` ruby
client = Valued::Client.new(token)

# reuse client globally
Valued.connect(client)
Valued.action("profile.updated", "user.id" => 42)
```

## Object mapping

In the examples above, you have to construct the data hashes for users and similar objects yourself when interacting with Valued. Sometimes it would be nice if you could hand your own user and customer objects to `valued-client`:

``` ruby
Valued.action("profile.updated", user: User.current)
```

You have two options to do so.

### Option 1: Define `to_valued_data`

``` ruby
# Assuming this is your user model
class User
  attr_accessor :name, :email, :id
  def to_valued_data = { name: name, email: email, id: id }
end
```

### Option 2: Registereing a converter

This option is handy if you want to keep your Valued logic out of your models, or if you want to create logic for objects outside your control:

``` ruby
Valued::Data.register(User) do |user|
  { id: user.id, name: user.name, email: user.email }
end
```

### Nested objects

Imagine users would have a nested location object. You could handle this in the user conversion logic:

``` ruby
Valued::Data.register(User) do |user|
  { id: user.id, locaion: { country:  user.location.country, region: user.region }}
end
```

However, you would need to repeat this logic for customers as well. Instead, you can register a converter for your location objects:

``` ruby
Valued::Data.register(User) {{ id: _1.id, location: _1.location }}
Valued::Data.register(Location) {{ country: _1.country, region: _1.region }}
```

## Custom HTTP client

By default, `Valued::Client` will use `Net::HTTP` for sending events. You can replace the HTTP client used by either passing a block to `Valued::Client.new`/`Valued.connect`, or any object that implements `#call`.

``` ruby
require "faraday"
token    = ENV.fetch("VALUED_TOKEN")
endpoint = ENV["VALUED_ENDPOINT"] || "https://ingres.valued.app/events"

Valued.connect do |data|
  Faraday.post(endpoint, data.to_json, {
    "Content-Type"  => "application/json",
    "Authorization" => "Bearer #{token}"
  })
end
```

Here is a more complex example for reusing headers generated by `valued-client`:

``` ruby
require "faraday"

class MyBackend
  def initialize(...)
    @connection = Valued::Connection.new(...)
  end

  def call(data)
    Faraday.post(@connection.endpoint, data.to_json, @connection.headers)
  end
end

token = ENV.fetch("VALUED_TOKEN")
Valued.connect MyBackend.new(token)
```

## Background processing

By default, this library will send events to Valued out of band to not unnecessarily block your business logic. The only exception is if a test environment is detected, in which case the HTTP requests will be sent synchronously.

You have control this behavior by setting a custom `executor`:

``` ruby
# use a fixed threadpool
Valued::Connection.executor = Concurrent::FixedThreadPool.new(5)

# disable background processing
Valued::Connection.executor = Concurrent::ImmediateExecutor.new
```

You can also reuse an existing executor to avoid a dedicated background thread for Valued.

You do not need to use any of the executors provided by concurrent-ruby. The only thing the `executor` needs to implement is a method called `post` that will schedule the passed block to be executed some time soon.

Here is an example for using EventMachine's `defer` method:

``` ruby
class MyExecutor
  def post(&block) = EventMachine.defer(block)
end

Valued::Connection.executor = MyExecutor.new
```
